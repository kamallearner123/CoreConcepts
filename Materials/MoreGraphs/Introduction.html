    <h1>Recap & Importance of Graphs in System Design: A Deep Dive</h1>

    <!-- What Are Graphs -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. What Are Graphs? A Quick Recap</h2>
        <p>Graphs are like the <span class="highlight">secret sauce</span> of system design—they’re everywhere, quietly making things work! At their core, graphs are mathematical structures that represent <span class="highlight">relationships</span> between entities. Let’s break it down:</p>
        
        <h3>1.1 Components of a Graph</h3>
        <div class="sub-section">
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Nodes (Vertices):</span> The "things" in your system—people, cities, computers, you name it. Think of them as dots on a map.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Edges:</span> The connections between nodes. They can be:
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Directed:</span> One-way, like a tweet from you to a follower.</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Undirected:</span> Two-way, like a mutual friendship.</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Weighted:</span> With values (e.g., distance, cost), like a 5-mile road.</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Unweighted:</span> Just a link, no extra info.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>1.2 A Simple Graph Example</h3>
        <div class="sub-section">
            <p>Imagine a tiny friend group:</p>
            <pre>
            Alice --- Bob
              |       |
            Carol --- Dave
            (Undirected edges = mutual friendships)
            </pre>
            <p>Here, Alice is friends with Bob and Carol, Bob with Alice and Dave, and so on. This is a graph in action—simple, yet powerful!</p>
        </div>

        <h3>1.3 Why Recap This?</h3>
        <div class="sub-section">
            <p>In system design, graphs aren’t just abstract concepts—they’re the blueprint for modeling real-world systems. Whether it’s a social app, a delivery network, or the internet, graphs give us a way to <span class="highlight">visualize</span> and <span class="highlight">solve</span> problems involving connections.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Importance of Graphs -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Why Are Graphs Important in System Design?</h2>
        <p>Graphs aren’t just a nerdy math trick—they’re <span class="highlight">superheroes</span> in the world of system design. They tackle problems that flat data structures (like lists or tables) can’t touch. Here’s why they’re a big deal:</p>

        <h3>2.1 Modeling Complexity</h3>
        <div class="sub-section">
            <p>Real life is messy—people connect in weird ways, roads twist and turn, servers talk to each other unpredictably. Graphs handle this chaos by representing <span class="highlight">intricate relationships</span>. Unlike a table that lists users separately, a graph links them naturally.</p>
            <p><strong>Mini Example:</strong> A family tree:</p>
            <pre>
            Grandma --> Mom --> You
            Grandma --> Uncle --> Cousin
            (Directed edges show parent-child relationships)
            </pre>
            <p>Querying "Who’s my cousin?" is a breeze with a graph—just traverse from you to Grandma, then down to Cousin!</p>
        </div>

        <h3>2.2 Scalability</h3>
        <div class="sub-section">
            <p>Graphs don’t flinch when systems get huge. Algorithms like shortest path or traversal can scale to handle <span class="highlight">millions of nodes</span>—think billions of users on Twitter or packages at Amazon. They’re designed to grow with your system.</p>
            <p><strong>Mini Example:</strong> A delivery network:</p>
            <pre>
            Warehouse --2--> City A --3--> City B
               |                       |
              5                      1
               |                       |
            City C ---------------> City D
            (Weighted edges = delivery times in hours)
            </pre>
            <p>Finding the fastest delivery route scales up easily, even if you add 100 more cities!</p>
        </div>

        <h3>2.3 Versatility</h3>
        <div class="sub-section">
            <p>Graphs are the Swiss Army knives of system design—they fit almost anywhere! From optimizing traffic to recommending movies, their flexibility is unmatched.</p>
            <p><strong>Mini Example:</strong> A recommendation system:</p>
            <pre>
            You --> Movie A --> User X
             |                  |
            Movie B --------> User Y
            (Edges = "watched" relationships)
            </pre>
            <p>If User X and Y liked Movie A and B, the graph suggests Movie B to you—versatile and clever!</p>
        </div>

        <h3>2.4 Real-Time Analytics</h3>
        <div class="sub-section">
            <p>In a fast-moving world, graphs deliver <span class="highlight">instant insights</span>. Need to reroute traffic during a crash? Detect fraud as it happens? Graphs make it possible with quick traversals and updates.</p>
            <p><strong>Mini Example:</strong> Traffic rerouting:</p>
            <pre>
            A --1--> B --2--> D
            |        |
            4       10 (Blocked!)
            |        |
            C --3--> E
            (Find new route: A -> C -> E when B -> E is blocked)
            </pre>
            <p>Graphs adapt in real-time, keeping systems responsive.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Interesting Examples -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Interesting Examples of Graphs in Action</h2>
        <p>Let’s see graphs strut their stuff in the real world!</p>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>3.1 Social Networks (Facebook)</h3>
            <p>Facebook is a <span class="highlight">graph playground</span>. You’re a node, your friends are connected by edges, and the system uses this to suggest new pals or show mutual connections.</p>
            <pre>
            You --- Friend A --- Friend B
             |                  |
            Friend C --------> Friend D
            (Friend D suggested via mutual connections)
            </pre>
            <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Facebook’s graph has over 2 billion nodes—talk about scalability!</p>
            <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Graphs make social connections fast and personalized.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>3.2 GPS Navigation (Google Maps)</h3>
            <p>Google Maps turns roads into a <span class="highlight">weighted graph</span>. Cities are nodes, roads are edges with weights (distance or time), and it finds the quickest path for you.</p>
            <pre>
            Home --10min--> Stop A --5min--> Work
             |                        |
            15min                  8min
             |                        |
            Stop B --3min---------> Stop C
            (Fastest: Home -> Stop A -> Work, 15min)
            </pre>
            <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> It updates edges in real-time based on traffic!</p>
            <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Graphs get you to work on time (or at least try to).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>3.3 Internet Routing</h3>
            <p>The internet is a massive graph of <span class="highlight">routers</span> (nodes) and <span class="highlight">links</span> (edges). Data packets hop through this graph to reach you.</p>
            <pre>
            You --> Router A --> Router B --> Server
             |            |             |
            Router C --> Router D --> Router E
            (Multiple paths; shortest wins!)
            </pre>
            <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Protocols like BGP use graph algorithms to optimize this.</p>
            <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Graphs keep your Netflix binge uninterrupted.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>3.4 Package Delivery (Amazon)</h3>
            <p>Amazon’s logistics is a graph of <span class="highlight">warehouses</span>, <span class="highlight">trucks</span>, and <span class="highlight">destinations</span>. Edges represent travel times or costs.</p>
            <pre>
            Warehouse --> Hub A --> You
               |             |
            Hub B --> Store --> Neighbor
            (Optimize: Warehouse -> Hub A -> You)
            </pre>
            <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Graphs help Amazon deliver in hours, not days!</p>
            <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Graphs make your packages arrive lightning-fast.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
